Lately, I’ve been working on a data visualization project.

I’ve always been interested in data visualization, and I’ve had the opportunity to work on similar projects in my professional journey - ranging from simple plots to dynamic, interactive visualizations, including geographic data representation.

This project visualizes population and world fertility data from 1960 to 2023, highlighting major trends and key observations from the datasets.

Here are some of the visualizations included:

- Total population graph
- Population rate color grid
- Population by country
- Top countries with declining populations
- World fertility rate over the years
- Fertility levels and their impact
- Fertility rate by country with a fertility level selector

In the video below, I provide an overview of the project.
