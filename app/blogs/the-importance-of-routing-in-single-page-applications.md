Routing is a fundamental concept in server-side applications where the client requests a particular route, and the server returns the HTML for that route.

In Single Page Applications (SPAs), while routing isn't mandatory, implementing it can significantly enhance the usability of your application. SPAs allow developers to manage views dynamically by leveraging JavaScript to manipulate content based on client-side conditions.

### Managing Views with JavaScript

You could manage views in SPAs with simple `if` statements, altering the views based on conditions, since the client has the entire JavaScript loaded and no server-side rendering occurs.

### What is a Route in an SPA?

It's useful to consider what a route actually represents in an SPA. It's tempting to think of it merely as a 'web page,' but a route is actually a state of the application. When you navigate between routes, you're navigating between different states of the app.

Thus, a route provides the user with a means of returning to a particular state of the application.

**Example Routes:**

- `domain/channel-name`
- `domain/channel-name/playlists`
- `domain/channel-name/shorts`

With routes like these, your SPA can determine the appropriate content to display. Instead of always showing the landing page, the app can navigate to a specific page.

The significance of routing extends beyond just initial interactions. By bookmarking URLs associated with specific routes, users can effortlessly revisit desired states within the application.

You should implement a route in an SPA when there's a state of the app that you want the user to be able to return to.

### Managing URLs with the History API

To manage URLs and their state, the History API was introduced with HTML5, providing two essential methods: `pushState()` and `replaceState()`.
